## Background
Rogue-like games are named after the first such program: a fantasy game named rogue. They were very popular in the days before home computers
were capable of elaborate graphics, and still have a small but dedicated following. If you would like
more information about roguelike games, a good site is http://www.roguebasin.com/.

In this game, you are a survivor of the Zombie Apocalypse. The dead have risen from their graves and
destroyed society as we know it. You and a small group of other people have retreated to a compound
in the woods to defend it as best you can.
